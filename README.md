# 🚂 Mexican Train

A web application built with SvelteKit, shadcn-svelte, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This project calculates the longest path possible in the game of Mexican Train, allowing users to select start pieces and the center piece.

## 🎯 Motivation

The primary motivation for this project was to learn more about [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction#What-is-SvelteKit) and improve my front-end development skills by building a interactive application. Additionally, after playing Mexican Train a few times with friends, I became interested in the game and wanted to create a tool to help players calculate the longest possible path.

## 🧩 How to Play

1. Select your start pieces from the domino pool.

2. Input the center piece.

3. Click **Calculate Longest Train**.

4. View the longest possible path displayed visually.
